## Delta Updates

Sparkle supports "delta updates" for your application: when possible, users can download only the bits that have changed. These updates can be much smaller to download and faster to install.

For each new version you release, you can provide a list of `.delta` files in addition to the "full" archive of the version. Each `.delta` contains the information necessary to upgrade from a single older version.

If the user is running a version of the app for which you haven't provided a `.delta`, or if the patch doesn't apply cleanly, they'll use the non-delta "full" update.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Note:</strong> Due to a macOS change, new delta patches must be created using generate_appcast or BinaryDelta from a Sparkle 1.27.0 or later distribution. Note that newly generated patches are still compatible and can be patched from applications using versions of Sparkle framework older than 1.27.0.
</div>

### Automated generation

The `./bin/generate_appcast` tool that comes with Sparkle [automatically generates and signs delta updates](/documentation/#5-publish-your-appcast).

### Manual generation

To generate a `.delta`, you use the `BinaryDelta` tool included with Sparkle like this:

```sh
BinaryDelta create --version=$FORMAT_VERSION path/to/old/MyApp.app path/to/new/MyApp.app patch.delta
```

Please see [Compatibility](#Compatibility) section below on what `FORMAT_VERSION` to use.

To verify that your generated patch applies correctly:

```sh
BinaryDelta apply path/to/old/MyApp.app path/to/patched/MyApp.app patch.delta
```

[Sign each `.delta` file](/documentation/#3-segue-for-security-concerns) and add an enclosure to your appcast's `<item>` in `<sparkle:deltas>` for each `.delta` file:

```xml
<item>

                  length="1485"
                  type="application/octet-stream"
                  sparkle:edSignature="..." />
       <enclosure url="http://you.com/1.6-2.0.delta"
                  sparkle:deltaFrom="1.6"
                  length="1428"
                  type="application/octet-stream"
                  sparkle:edSignature="..." />
   </sparkle:deltas>
</item>
```

### Compatibility

When you create a delta update between two versions of your application, you must ensure you are using a delta format version that your older application knows how to patch. Below is a table describing the requirements for each binary delta version.

| Delta Version | Requirements                  | Major Changes                                                                                        |
| -----------   | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3             | Sparkle 2.1 (in development)  | More efficient custom delta container format, lzma compression + other compression options, file rename heuristic tracking. |
| 2             | Sparkle 1.10                  | Improved and changed hash function for reducing collisions.                                          |
| 1             | Sparkle 1.5 (now unsupported) | Added initial binary delta format using libxar and bzip2 compression. Tracking of insertions, deletions, and binary file diffs using bsdiff. |

Note if you are using `generate_appcast`, picking the delta version to use is automatically handled. If you are using `BinaryDelta` though, you will need to pass the appropriate delta version via the `--version` argument.

Older delta format versions will eventually be phased out. Please do not create new patches using an older version than necessary. Always use the latest tools when creating delta patches because they may contain minor bug fixes that don't require a major format change.

### Tips for Improving Download Size & Performance

We recommend reading Apple's article on [reducing the download size for iOS app updates](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1779/_index.html), which is applicable here too. To reword:

* Do not make unnecessary modifications to files. Compare the contents of the prior and new versions of your app and verify that you've only changed what you expect within your app bundle. Running `BinaryDelta --verbose` will show a diff of what has changed.
* Content that you expect to change in an update should be stored in separate files from content that you don't expect to change. This reduces the size of the delta update and increases its install speed.
* Avoid renaming files or folders. Our version 3 delta format has heuristics for tracking when files are moved around in some cases however.
